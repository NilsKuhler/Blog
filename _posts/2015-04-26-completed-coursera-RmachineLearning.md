This blog is about a Coursera "Practical Machine Learning" course that I completed. 

## Coursera course "Practical Machine Learning"

Details about the course:


{% include course_detail.md selectedcourse=531 %}


## Comments an course result


Here is one of the example programs developped for the course:

Here is a motivation for the prediction:

Here is the final result:

The final result is also available als github page:

Since I dd the course in 2015 a lot of R resources have become available. E.g. 

<https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/machine-learning-in-r>

It is unlikely that I will reuse this code since this course result is from 2015. 
If there is an opportunity I will do an R update course and update my blog. 

## Considerations before using R for machine learning

There several considerations when selecting R as a solution for machine learning. 
R can be a good choice for machine learning. These day Python seems to become very popular in the Data science community. E.g. check the following:
