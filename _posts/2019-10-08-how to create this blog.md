This blog item is about how to create this jekyll github website and blog items on this blog.

## Jekyll into

Jekyll is used to create simple static blow aware websites.
More about jekyll can be found here <https://jekyllrb.com/>

## Selecting a jekyll theme

This is the most fun part of creating a jekyll blog. Selecting the a theme for jekyll. 
On the web you can find a lot of nice looking/ready made jekyll (theme) resources. 

I found my theme for this blog website on <https://github.com/Gaohaoyang/gaohaoyang.github.io>
The original theme is in chinese. Use a demo of his site in combination with google translate to see what is on the site. 

You can to download a desired theme to a local directory. 
From this local directory where you installed your theme, you should start the docker commands to startup jekyll 

## Jekyll Usage

Normally it is not straight forward to install all jekyll and ruby dependancies on a local machine. Therefore we make use of jekyll docker image. 
A how-to blog about the usage of the jekyll docker image can be found on <https://davemateer.com/2018/01/25/Jekyll-and-Docker>
A quick windows 10 note. I think it is better to create a local windows user and use this one to let docker access a local volume.
I think it is better to provide docker with a local windows user instead of your personal account.  

## Adding/Changing Posts

Youâ€™ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

The posts are using markdown sytax.

One of the first actions when your blog website works is to create, edit and experimet yourself with an markdown file to start you first entry in the post list. 
Please use the same file name convention as the other files.

The file that you created will be directly visible. Changes that you make will also be directly visible. 

## Mark-down Syntax
A markdown syntax guide can be found here <https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet>
In the header of a markdown document the possibilities can be extended. 
E.g. by configuring in de markdown header
```---
...
mathjax: true
...
---
$$
f(x) = ax + b
$$
Inline Mathjax $a \neq b$
```
Results:
$$
f(x) = ax + b
$$ 
Inline Mathjax $a \neq b$

## index.html

Need to change the line "Welcome to HyG's Blog!" To your own name or acronym. 

## Similar Post and Comment section

issue: On pages there should be a Similar Post section H2 Header. This does not appear always. Sometimes in Chinese??
I temporarily solve this manually by adding a H2 section "Similar Content"

issue: For comments the site uses discus. Since I want a simple readonly blog without any comments I want to take it out. 

## TODOs, Work in Progress ....

1. I have removed the collections, demo and about pages. 
Will implement them whan I have my own versions ready. 

2. The comment section I want to take out on the all the pages since I want this site to be read only.

## Checking in your version of the blog into github.com/

The good news if that you do not have to install a github client to checkin the version of your blog. 
You can use the same jekyll Docker instance to do the work for you. Git is installed in this docker image. 

The github commands you need you can find here
<https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line>

With the github commands you can upload the (intial) version to your github account. 
Make sure you are in the right directory. 
```
bash-5.0# pwd
/srv/jekyll
bash-5.0# ls
LICENSE      _config.yml  _includes    _posts       _site        css          feed.xml     js
README.md    _drafts      _layouts     _sass        assets       favicon.ico  index.html   page
```
