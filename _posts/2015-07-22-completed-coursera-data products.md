## Use case

"Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R. You can host standalone apps on a webpage or embed them in R Markdown documents or build dashboards. You can also extend your Shiny apps with CSS themes, htmlwidgets, and JavaScript actions." For more information check.

For clients who want to publish some interactive Data (Science) content to the web using R and Shiny as a solution can be considered. For some demonstrations please review:
