This blog is about a Coursera "Practical Machine Learning" course that I completed. 

## Coursera course "Practical Machine Learning"

Details about the course:


{% include course_detail.md selectedcourse=531 %}


## This page will be updated ... 
This page will be updated **As soon as I will do a update course on R in 2019**.

## Comments an course result

The course solution result shown on github pages for this course is incomplete and not clear. 
The solution needs to be extended with the orignal assignment and some clearification need to be added how the result was realized.

It needs to be rewritten in a similar style as the following page:

<https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/machine-learning-in-r>


It is unlikely that I will reuse this code since this course result is from 2015. I will  do an update on R machine learning and blog about an updated R machine learning course.

## Considerations before using R for machine learning

There several considerations when selecting R as a solution for machine learning. 
R can be a good choice for machine learning. These day Python seems to become very popular in the Data science community. E.g. check the following:
