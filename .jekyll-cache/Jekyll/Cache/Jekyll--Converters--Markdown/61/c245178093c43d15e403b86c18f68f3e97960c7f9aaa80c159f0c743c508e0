<p>I added a complete course list as an application page to this blog. 
All completed courses can be found in the top right menu. 
All course can be found here:</p>

<p><a href="/course/">course page</a></p>

<h2 id="added-new-generic-course-info-include-page">Added new generic course info include page</h2>

<p>Also an generic course component info which can be used to display specific course info on a blog page is created.
This generic component can be found in the include folder underneeth the blog pages.</p>

<p>This component wil/can be reused in my blog pages. Check the following example:
<a href="/2015/04/26/completed-coursera-RmachineLearning/">blog page with course component info</a></p>
