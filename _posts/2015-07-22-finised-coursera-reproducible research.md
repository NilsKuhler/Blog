This blog is about a Coursera Data Science course "https://www.coursera.org/learn/reproducible-research" that I have finished. 

## Coursera course "Reproducible research"

Details about the course can be found here. 

<https://www.coursera.org/learn/reproducible-research>

Extract course description
"This course focuses on the concepts and tools behind reporting modern data analyses in a reproducible manner. Reproducible research is the idea that data analyses, and more generally, scientific claims, are published with their data and software code so that others may verify the findings and build upon them."


The (final) results can be found here:
