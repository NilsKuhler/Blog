## Added new course pages to this blog

I added a complete course list as an application page to this blog. 
All completed courses can be found in the top right menu. 
All course can be found here:

[course page](/course/)

## Added new generic course info include page

Also an generic course component info which can be used to display specific course info on a blog page is created.
This generic component can be found in the include folder underneeth the blog pages.

This component wil/can be reused in my blog pages. Check the following example:
[blog page with course component info](/2015/04/26/completed-coursera-RmachineLearning/)
